##Beanshell
#Homepage: https://beanshell.github.io/
----------------
#Installation: { pkg install beanshell } 
------------------
#Beanshell is a fully Java compatible scripting language. 
#BeanShell is now capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and loading .java source files from the class path.
#BeanShell scripted classes are fully typed and appear to outside Java code and via reflective inspection as ordinary classes.
#However their implementation is fully dynamic and they may include arbitrary BeanShell scripts in their bodies, methods, and constructors.
#Users may now freely mix loose,unstructured BeanShell scripts, method closures, and full scripted classes.
